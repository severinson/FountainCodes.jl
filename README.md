# FountainCodes.jl

This package implements [Raptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor_code) and [Luby Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luby_transform_code) (LT) erasure correction codes in the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/). In particular, it implements Raptor10 codes (specified in [rfc5053](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5053)) and RaptorQ codes (specified in [rfc6330](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6330)). The LT code implementation does not follow any particular standard, but can be used with any degree distribution (e.g., the robust Soliton distribution available via [Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl)).

Examples on how to use Raptor10, RaptorQ, LT, and LDPC codes with the included decoder are available in [examples/examples.jl](examples/examples.jl).

This package implements inactivation decoding (specified in [rfc6330](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6330)), which is an efficient algorithm for solving sparse systems of equations of the form `Ax=b`, with most of the optimizations suggested in [rfc6330](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6330), such as peeling constraints lazily and using largest-component inactivation. See, e.g., chapter 4 of the [MSc thesis of Francisco LÃ¡zaro](https://elib.dlr.de/122389/1/thesis.pdf) for an easy-to-follow overview of the algorithm.

Note that, although inactivation decoding was proposed as a decoding algorithm for Raptor codes, it is at its core just a version of Gaussian elimination optimized for sparse matrices with a particular set of properties. The decoder assumes there is a unique solution to the system of equations, i.e., it is not a least squares solver in the style of the `\` operator.

The Raptor10 and RaptorQ implementations assume that operations are performed over a compatible field (e.g., using the `GF256` type implemented in [src/GF256.jl](src/GF256.jl)), but the LT code implementation and decoder is compatible with any field (including the reals, e.g., using the `Float64` type).
